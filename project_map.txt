
### 1. Directory Structure

Organize the project files for scalability and maintainability:

```
/controllers
  - authController.js
  - userController.js
  - shipmentController.js
  - orderController.js
/models
  - User.js
  - Shipment.js
  - Order.js
  - Vehicle.js
/routes
  - authRoutes.js
  - userRoutes.js
  - shipmentRoutes.js
  - orderRoutes.js
/middlewares
  - authMiddleware.js
  - roleMiddleware.js
/config 
  - db.js
/utils
  - logger.js
  - errorHandler.js
```

### 2. Define Models

Define complex models to handle various aspects of a logistics system:

- **User**: Handles users with roles like admin, client, and driver.
  - Fields: `username`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `contactInfo`, `assignedOrders`.

- **Shipment**: Manages details of shipments.
  - Fields: `trackingNumber`, `origin`, `destination`, `status`, `vehicleAssigned`, `driverAssigned`, `expectedDeliveryDate`, `deliveryDate`.

- **Order**: Tracks individual orders being shipped.
  - Fields: `orderId`, `client`, `items`, `shipment`, `status`, `orderDate`, `deliveryDate`.

- **Vehicle**: Manages vehicles in the logistics fleet.
  - Fields: `vehicleId`, `type`, `capacity`, `driverAssigned`, `status`, `location`.
.
### 3. Authentication and Authorization

Implement advanced user authentication and role-based access control:

- **User Registration & Login**:
  - Register users (e.g., clients, drivers, admins) and hash passwords using bcrypt.
  - Validate login credentials and issue JWT tokens with embedded roles.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Implement middleware to restrict access based on roles (e.g., only admins can manage users, only drivers can update shipment status).

### 4. Core Functionality

Implement the key logistics features:

- **Shipment Management**:
  - Admins and clients can create and manage shipments.
  - Drivers can update the status of shipments (e.g., "in transit", "delivered").

- **Order Management**:
  - Clients can place orders, which are associated with shipments.
  - Admins can track and update orders.
  - Drivers can see assigned orders and update delivery status.

- **Vehicle Management**:
  - Admins manage vehicle assignment, status (e.g., "in service", "under maintenance"), and drivers.

### 5. User Roles and Permissions

Define user roles and enforce permissions:

- **Roles**:
  - `admin`: Full control over the system (e.g., managing users, shipments, and vehicles).
  - `client`: Create and track orders, view shipment status.
  - `driver`: View assigned shipments, update status.

- **Permissions**:
  - Use middleware to restrict access to routes based on user roles.

### 6. Routes

Define detailed routes with complex flows for your system:

- **Auth Routes**:
  - `/auth/register` (for different roles)
  - `/auth/login`
  - `/auth/logout`

- **User Routes**:
  - `/users/` (admin only)
  - `/users/:id` (view or update profile)

- **Shipment Routes**:
  - `/shipments/` (create, list, update)
  - `/shipments/:trackingNumber` (view shipment status)

- **Order Routes**:
  - `/orders/` (create, list, update)
  - `/orders/:orderId` (view order details)

- **Vehicle Routes**:
  - `/vehicles/` (create, list, update vehicle details)

### 7. Middleware

Use middleware for additional functionalities:

- **Authentication Middleware**:
  - Ensure JWT tokens are validated before granting access to protected routes.

- **Role-Based Middleware**:
  - Implement role checks to restrict specific actions (e.g., only admins can delete users).

- **Logging Middleware**:
  - Log important events (e.g., user login attempts, shipment status changes) for auditing.

### 8. Database Design (MongoDB)

Design your collections to handle complex relations:

- **Users** collection:
  - Each user can have multiple roles (e.g., a driver might also be an admin).
  
- **Shipments** collection:
  - Each shipment references an order and driver.

- **Orders** collection:
  - Each order references a client and is linked to a shipment.

- **Vehicles** collection:
  - Each vehicle is linked to a driver and can be assigned to shipments.

### 9. Additional Features (Optional)

To enhance the logistics platform, consider implementing:

- **Real-Time Tracking**:
  - Integrate real-time GPS tracking for vehicles and display shipment locations.
  
- **Notification System**:
  - Notify clients and drivers about important updates via email or SMS.

- **Data Analytics**:
  - Provide admins with dashboards that show metrics like delivery times, vehicle usage, and driver performance.

### 10. Error Handling and Security

- **Centralized Error Handling**:
  - Use a global error handler to catch and manage all exceptions.

- **Input Validation**:
  - Validate user input using libraries like `Joi` or `express-validator`.

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Implement rate limiting, secure password hashing, and protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
